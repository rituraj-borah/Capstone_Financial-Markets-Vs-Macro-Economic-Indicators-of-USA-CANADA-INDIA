# Financial Markets Vs Macro-Economic Indicators of USA: 
(_Tools used: Python, Excel, Tableau and Data download using API_)

## Overview
This Capstone project explores the intricate relationships between financial markets and macro-economic indicators in the United States through comprehensive data analysis and visualization. Utilizing a blend of Python for data processing, Excel for data manipulation, and Tableau for insightful visualization, this study aims to uncover patterns, trends, and potential correlations that exist within the financial landscape and broader economic indicators.

## Objectives
To analyze the behavior of key financial market indices in relation to major macro-economic indicators such as GDP growth rates, unemployment rates, inflation rates, and others.
To identify and visualize trends, correlations, and anomalies between the financial markets and macro-economic indicators over a specified period.
To provide an accessible way for users to interact with the findings through dynamic and informative visualizations in Tableau.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gathered historical data on financial market indices (such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ) and macro-economic indicators (GDP, unemployment rate, inflation rate, etc.) relevant to the USA.
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Utilized Python to clean, process, and analyze the collected data. Python's powerful libraries such as Pandas and NumPy were instrumental in handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Data Manipulation**: Employed Python and Microsoft Excel for additional data manipulation tasks, enabling a more granular approach to data preparation and preliminary analysis.
- **Visualization**: Leveraged Tableau's robust visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and graphs that illustrate the relationships and findings derived from the analysis. These visualizations are designed to be user-friendly, allowing for an intuitive exploration of the data.

## Results
The project successfully identifies significant patterns and correlations between the financial markets and macro-economic indicators, providing insights into how economic trends can impact financial market performance and vice versa. The interactive dashboards in Tableau enable users to delve into specific areas of interest, offering a personalized exploration of the data.

## Conclusion
This Capstone project underscores the importance of integrating data analysis and visualization techniques to understand complex relationships between financial markets and macro-economic indicators. By utilizing Python, Excel, and Tableau, this study offers a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and presenting data in a way that is both informative and accessible to a broad audience.

## Future Work
Suggestions for future research include expanding the dataset to include data for country like India and Canada economic indicators, exploring predictive modeling techniques to forecast market trends, and creating an end-to-end pipeline to automate the process using Azure and Power BI.
